mental distress; a 


wave

keepers_r

should always be in there!!
finish survey and has net variables

tsex_rinal_r
gender

cms_r
both parents?

depr_2
binary--no!

cavgdepr
linear --- averaged across (with so it includes missing values)
depression + anxiety (average + anxiety) --- pick out by hand

sum depression to pick out
## include depression
## cdep 02 03 04 07 09 / never (0), sometimes(1), often(2)

## others are in anxiety scale

psamesexuc
proportion same gender / undirected ties

emcavdepruc / alterdistress
#probably use this -- this is more conservative ---

emcavdepruc_es 
don't worry about that one

indegc
#indegree ties 

recipc
#reciprocal ties

egondenuc
#density --- out of all connections could be connected ; friends are friends

ertnstvtyc
#likelihood a fof is a friend of each other
#alternate measure of transitivity -- a little more specific and networky

boncentuc
#bonacet centrality -- popular amongst popular people


--------------
what's the hook that makes it special?  

We expect depression and the relationship to change over time --- trajectory and relationship between IV and DV --- this is why we have to use the ALT

---------------
What is a predictor and what is a control?
 - degrees
 - proportion same-sex
 - alterdep (punting)

boncentuc = 4 and .5 (average .7)

----------------------
outdeg/indeg are counts --- make binary indicator for maximizing outdeg = 7
7 blanks --- function of survey instrument and churn... ****


###find and don't find...
1) density (we can try this --- curvilinear; interesting work here); 2) centrality; 


###get permission from prosper --- make up something or use jim's embededness measure --- something to deal with or offer as a way to do it

###peer effect and then ties themselves (instead of just a control)...

-------------------
use wave 4 as a baseline 5 - 8; 5 is wierd because of hs, and 7 and 8 (from a data standpoint)

#####transition variable --- pretty much everyone // newness effect //
see if school variable changes

8=12
7=11
6=10
5=9
